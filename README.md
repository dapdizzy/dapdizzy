- 👋 Hi, I’m @dapdizzy
- 👀 I’m interested in coding neat stuff using C#, Elixir, Elm, Rust, Haskell
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some Rust may be, but actually I'm trying to make something meaningful with Elixir as I really like it, I believe it is a robust language I can make some meaningful 'glue-code' library or app with and probably introduce something new of my own. Rust is still theoretical for me, though I love how it looks for the most part.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating payments receiving app based on Telegram Payments API (for instance). I believe it is both hard and important to jump-start the project. Later it will be no big deal coding whaever problem when there is a basis for it.
